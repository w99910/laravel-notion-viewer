# Getting Notion API Key

I am going to show you how you can get Notion API key for internal use.

For public Notion Integrations, please
consult [Notion API Documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started#public-notion-integrations).

- ## Creating Internal Integration
    - Go to [My Integrations Page](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
    - Click "Create New Integration" button
    - Fill the form
    - Click "Create Integration" button
    - Copy the API key `Internal Integration Token`

- ## Giving your integration access to your Notion Page
    - Go to your Notion Page
    - Click "..." button at the top right of the page.
    - Click the button "Add connections" under Connections category.
    - Search your integration and click it - **If you can't find your integration, consider refreshing the page**
    - Click "Confirm"

- ## Finding Page ID.
    - Go to your Notion Page
    - E.g. Your url would be `https://www.notion.so/user/Getting-Started-19ed635a86e04b52b32134d762ce91c78`
    - The `19ed635a86e04b52b32134d762ce91c78` would be your page ID.
